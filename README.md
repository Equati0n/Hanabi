# 花火 适配Xcode 14.0 和Apple Silicon Mac
将使用substitute改为使用[Dobby](https://github.com/jmpews/Dobby)

增加了New Pass Manager的Hook

LLVM Pass可以从[https://github.com/61bcdefg/Hikari-LLVM15-Core](https://github.com/61bcdefg/Hikari-LLVM15-Core) [https://github.com/61bcdefg/Hikari-LLVM15-Headers](https://github.com/61bcdefg/Hikari-LLVM15-Headers)获取，移植到对应的swift llvm再配合这个仓库编译即可
# 花火

# Must be this tall to ride
Due to its hackish nature (Which is why I don't want to do this in the first place), you should probably know some LLVM/macOS Hooking/Binary Patching and stuff to debug this thing

# Building
- ``$(LLVM_SOURCE_PATH)`` The path that stored Hikari's main repo with submodules properly fetched. It's suggested to use a Hikari branch that matches your Apple Clang's LLVM version. See [Release Versioning Scheme](#release-versioning-scheme) to see how to find the LLVM version of your Clang
- ``${LLVM_BUILD_PATH}`` The path you prepare to build in. Note that you need a seperate folder and must not reuse existing build for upstream Hikari

## Obtaining Source
- ``git clone https://github.com/61bcdefg/Hanabi.git $(LLVM_SOURCE_PATH)/projects/``
- Under ``$(LLVM_SOURCE_PATH)``, run ``git submodule update --init --recursive --remote`` to make sure submodules are fully updated

## Build
- ``cmake $(LLVM_SOURCE_PATH) -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ABI_BREAKING_CHECKS=FORCE_OFF -G Ninja``
- ``ninja LLVMHanabi``
- Copy ``$(LLVM_BUILD_PATH)/lib/libLLVMHanabiDeps.dylib`` to ``/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/``
- Copy ``$(LLVM_BUILD_PATH)/lib/libLLVMHanabi.dylib`` to ``/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/``

# Patching

You need to build ``https://github.com/alexzielenski/optool`` and put it in your $PATH, then you need to patch two libraries into Clang/SwiftC.
**!!!ORDER IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!**
- ``sudo optool install -c load -p @executable_path/libLLVMHanabi.dylib -t /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/clang``
- ``sudo optool install -c load -p @executable_path/libLLVMHanabi.dylib -t /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/swift-frontend``
- ``sudo codesign -fs - /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/clang``
- ``sudo codesign -fs - /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/swift-frontend``


# How it works
- Strictly speaking, many changes are done to the Hikari Core to reduce LLVM library dependencies.
- Loader's linking options is modified to link to no LLVM library and fully resolve them at runtime in a flat namespace, this loader is also known as ``libLLVMHanabi.dylib``
- Then, we ship a custom mimimal subset of LLVM Core Libraries which serves as the fallback plan for symbols that are not exported in Apple's binaries, this is known as ``libLLVMHanabiDeps.dylib``.
- By not linking the full LLVM suite, we are allowed to reduce build time and more importantly, allows us to pass arguments like we normally would. (``-mllvm`` and ``-Xllvm``)


# Credits

- Thanks to [@AloneMonkey](https://github.com/AloneMonkey) for compiling substitute and ship it with his amazing project [MonkeyDev](https://github.com/AloneMonkey/MonkeyDev/blob/master/MFrameworks/libsubstitute.dylib)
- Thanks to [@UESTC-LXY](https://github.com/UESTC-LXY) for testing and discussion because I didn't bother to do so.
- Thanks to[@qokelate](https://github.com/qokelate) for initially discovering the broken CMake script and testing the new fix as well as suggestions to this README
